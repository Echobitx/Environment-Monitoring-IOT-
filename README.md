# Environment-Monitoring-IOT-
In this project i will solve a problem of monitoring an environment using IOT ( affordable ones) this will come in two parts one which is not wire or configured for the cloud and one which is using BLYNK. 

Software requirements
You need to do the following:
• Set up the EEPROM.
• Create a thread for reading from the ADC. The value read from the temperature sensor
needs to be converted to degrees Celsius. See the datasheet (linked above) for the
formula.
• Create interrupts for all the button functionality 
• Create an output signal to trigger the buzzer
• In the main() loop, print values to the screen.
